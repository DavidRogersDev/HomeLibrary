HomeLibrary

A Winforms application for managing your home library.

This is a sample application which has been developed to demonstrate how to use the [WinFormsMVP](http://winformsmvp.codeplex.com/ "winformsmvp") framework in the development of WinForms applications.

To track the approach and progress of the development of this sample app, the index for the blog posts can be [found here](http://www.davidrogers.id.au/wp/?page_id=2357 "Home Library").
